# FixMyRide
Description of Project :Â 
The project entails creating an intuitive website where users can describe their car problems in natural language. The system will employ machine learning and natural language processing techniques to match user inputs with a curated database of car issues and solutions. The project will likely have a database of every car and joint issues and problems with a given car. There will be a selector to choose from, and you will then type in the issue you are having, and it will display a solution from the database. The bot will become more accurate when you give it more information; for example, if you know you are having engine problems, the chatbot will find its database for that specific vehicle and look for solutions for the engine problems you described. If you want to switch cars at any time, you can change the selector or tell the bot.
