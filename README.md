# FixMyRide
Description of Project :Â 
The project entails creating an intuitive website where users can describe their car problems in natural language. The system will employ machine learning and natural language processing techniques to match user inputs with a curated database of car issues and solutions. The project will likely have a database and a form where users can add in their own data or notes. You can ask the bot your issues, and it will display a solution from the database taking in your own notes as data or just getting data from the database. The bot will become more accurate when you give it more information; for example, if you know you are having engine problems, the chatbot will find its database for that specific vehicle and look for solutions for the engine problems you described.
